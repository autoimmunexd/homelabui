This project serves as a showcase of techniques and technologies within my skillset utilizing Html, Css, Sql, Python, and Flask.  It serves as a dashboard for my homelab server.  I will update this at a later time.

Notes to myself -
```
#EXAMPLE OF WRONG WAY TO PASS DATA WITH THESE TWO ROUTES
# @app.route('/wiki')
# def wiki():
#     wiki = scrape_wikipedia_main_page()
#     return wiki

# @app.route('/weather')
# def weather():
#     weather = get_weather_data()
#     return weather

#TO DO LIST :
    #download upload in mb
    #disk free space used space
    #time day date
    #start, stop, restart and status of docker container with buttons
    #convert uptime and utilization to passthrough dashboard
```
